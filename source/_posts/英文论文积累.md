8. Within the CNN design, the recent work in neural architecture search (NAS) has demonstrated that automatically designed networks can match, and even surpass, the performance of CNNs designed by human experts, and has led to the discovery of novel state-of-the-art CNN architectures with modules, which are unlikely to be developed by human experts .在CNN设计中，最近在神经架构搜索（NAS）方面的工作表明，自动设计的网络可以匹配甚至超越人类专家设计的CNN的性能，并导致发现了具有模块的新颖的最先进的CNN架构，而人类专家不太可能开发这些架构。 #肯定研究成果
9. However, the most competitive NAS algorithms utilize predeﬁned, simple, skip-connection structures, despite the apparent importance of skip connections and the use of distinct, competing styles of skip connection appearing in state-of-the-art works 然而，最具竞争力的NAS算法利用了预定义的、简单的跳过连接结构，尽管跳过连接显然很重要，而且在最先进的作品中出现了不同的、竞争性的跳过连接样式 #研究介绍 
10. With regards to the breadth of scope of NAS algorithms, minimal research has been conducted with a focus on the automatic discovery of skip-connection structure in CNNs, and no published work has demonstrated an algorithm, which can successfully optimize skip-connection structure when the possible number of skip connections is large.关于 NAS 算法范围的广度，以 CNN 中跳跃连接结构的自动发现为重点的研究很少，也没有发表的作品展示了一种算法，当 可能的跳过连接数很大。
11. In practical applications, the discovery of novel skipconnection structures in deep networks provides the opportunity to optimize networks to be both smaller and more accurate for a given task, and do so in a way that does not conﬂict with existing methods which optimize the layers used in networks. This is of particular importance when considering the use of artiﬁcial neural networks in computation limited devices, such as mobile phones and autonomous vehicles .在实际应用中，深度网络中新颖的 skipconnection 结构的发现为优化网络提供了机会，使其针对给定任务变得更小、更准确，并且这样做的方式与现有的优化层的方法不冲突 网络。 当考虑在移动电话和自动驾驶汽车等计算受限设备中使用人工神经网络时，这一点尤为重要 [13]。  #skipconnection

## NAS评估成本
1. Furthermore, the high computational cost of NAS algorithms has led to many NAS algorithms utilizing performance estimation techniques to reduce computational cost. However, empirical justiﬁcations of the performance estimation techniques used are frequently lacking, leaving much NAS research in the dark with respect to the ramiﬁcations of these choices and possible alternatives to the chosen techniques [6].此外，NAS算法的高计算成本导致许多NAS算法利用性能估计技术来降低计算成本。 然而，所使用的性能估计技术的经验论据经常缺乏，使得许多 NAS 研究在这些选择的后果和所选技术的可能替代方案方面处于黑暗之中 [6]。
